Emulation Distribution based on Retropie with Attract Mode


This is an optimized Emulation Distribution for the Raspberry Zero (and Pi) based on the ARMv6 architecture
It is based on Retropie with Attract-Mode (and a little Emulationstation) as GUI.
The included theme and snaps (= gameplay preview videos) are optimized to run on ARMv6 smoothly.
Also the GUI is optimized for smaller 3.5" TFTs, ready for mobile-based Systems like the ZeroBOY or Gameboy Zero.
